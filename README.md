### Hi there 👋

I'm Yaeshwanth Urumaiya, a passionate Pythonic Programmer who's pursuing a BTech in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning! I have a keen interest in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, and I take up projects to learn the ways of an AI engineer 🐼.

Always up for connecting with people! 

### 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

I'm a third-year student who likes to work on python based projects and build indie games in Unity (C#). I'm always eager to learn and apply the latest technologies in AI and ML.

### 👩🏻‍💻 Current Projects:

AutoDrive: An automatic lane assist software for hands-free driving. Building it in a simulation enviroment to test the project. (Currently Ongoing.)
CodeStructures: A Web application to help students learn Data Structures and Algorithms. (Currently Ongoing.)

### Projects Not In Git: 

Early Collosion Detection: An automatic braking system for cars, meant to prediect objects and their trajectory to calcuate if in case the user's car is about to hit the object.
